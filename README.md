Dependencies
------------

This game requires Python 3.  I recommend installing the dependencies (Panda3D 1.10, esper) via pip, using the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the game
----------------

Open a terminal window, "cd" to the game directory and run:

```
python run_game.py
```

The game is intended to be controlled using the arrow keys.  It can also be operated using a gamepad with a directional pad.

The mouse can optionally be used to change the camera angle, which can be useful for looking at the other side of the die.
